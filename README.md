### Why we created Transfer Path
Each member of our team is a transfer student, and we created this web application with a deep personal connection to the transfer experience. We hope to impact the transfer process by providing a resource which can help to guide transfers through the process of choosing major prerequisites and a focus of study. Often students know where they want to be but not the steps they need to take to get there. We hope our tool provides value by offering insight into the necessary steps.

### Transfer Path's Goals
Our web app helps Seattle area transfer students with the process of deciding how to get “from here to there”, when deciding on a STEM related major and career direction, and the required prerequisites they need to take to get there.
